210661 images in total

# Preprocessing Steps
The goal of pre-processing is to improve the quality of the image so that we can analyze it more effectively.

- Rescale: the process of resizing a digital image.
- Rotation:  an image processing routine with applications in matching, alignment, and other image-based algorithms.
- Zoom: to enlarge an image so that the details of that image become more transparent and visible.
- Shear: shifts one part of the image like a parallelogram.

# Algorithm 
- CNN
- MLP
- LSTM

# Improvement Techniques 
- Improvement 1: Adding Layers
- Improvement 2: Modifying Parameters

# Improvement Details:
- Before improvement, the accuracy was 42%.
- Improvement 1: 
Add 7 layers, the accurcy was 89%
- Improvement 2: 
Change parameter,
Activation  liner -> relu, 
Optimiser adam -> rmsprop,
the accurcy was 86%
